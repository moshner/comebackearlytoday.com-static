He becomes more forgetful every day. Sometimes he doesn’t even recognize their friends, and he’s gotten lost driving home from the nearby grocery store three times. The other day he went out, leaving a pot of boiling water on the stove. The pot was badly burned, and Jill is afraid George is going to cause a fire.</p><p>So Jill talks to her best friend, Nancy, who advises her to take George to a neurologist. Jill decides to do that, but asks herself <em>which neurologist? </em>She doesn’t want to see just <em>any </em>neurologist—she wants to see one who specializes in <em>Alzheimer’s. </em>She wonders where she can find that information.</p><p>That’s where <a
href="https://www.xpertdox.com">XpertDox</a> comes in. It’s a free online searchable database—a one stop resource—that helps people find the best doctor and hospital for more than 6,000 rare and serious diseases without any input from doctors, patients, hospitals or pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>The fact that <a
href="https://www.xpertdox.com">XpertDox</a> doesn’t use patient reviews—which tend to be unreliable—is especially important. <a
href="https://www.xpertdox.com">XpertDox</a> research—published in the Journal of the American Medical Association—found that patients treated by doctors with the highest patient reviews have a 26% higher chance of dying compared with those treated by physicians with low ratings.</p><p>Co-founded by cardiologist and data scientist, Dr. Sameer Ather, (who also has a PhD in clinical investigation and big data) and nephrologist and physician scientist, Dr. Bhupesh Panwar, <a
href="https://www.xpertdox.com">XpertDox </a>already has 30,000 visitors per month from all over the world, and 6,000 registered users. You can search the database by disease, procedure, or physician.</p><p><a
href="https://www.xpertdox.com">XpertDox</a>, which went live in December of 2015, was born out of a passion to help patients with rare and serious diseases find personalized recommendations for their conditions. It empowers them with information specific to their condition, guiding them to seek the best possible care, and finally, it provides support by helping them connect to peers with similar conditions.</p><p><a
href="https://www.xpertdox.com">XpertDox</a> has taken the next step of enrolling patients with rare diseases in ongoing clinical trials. Planned features will include the ability to book doctor appointments online as well as the provision of online consulting and social networking.</p><p>To review the site, I used the terms “Alzheimer’s” and “dementia.”</p><p><strong>Information in the physician profiles: </strong>Each physician profile includes the physician’s address, phone number, gender, location, date of medical school graduation, hospital affiliation, top diseases that match his or her profile, links to the physician’s research articles’ abstracts, insurance accepted, and a map for directions to the doctor’s office. The profiles also list whether the physician participates in the Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System Improvement Program (PQRS). Some even include a photograph of the physician—a nice touch—and you can “like” individual doctors.</p><p>The profiles also include the percent match of the physician to the user’s individual disease. You can search for doctors nationwide or just for doctors practicing in your state or near your zip code.</p><p><strong>Information on the hospital profiles: </strong>Hospital profiles include the address, phone number, top specialties and procedures that match the hospital’s profile, ownership, and ratings of the hospital’s performance on more than 30 items. As with physicians, you can search for hospitals nationwide or find ones in your state or near your zip code.</p><p><strong>Information on the individual disease pages:</strong> The individual disease pages include extensive educational material about the disease. For example, the dementia page includes, among other things, an overview, epidemiology, types of dementia, treatment, and FDA-approved medications for dementia.</p><p>Other features are physicians’ answers to patients’ questions and information about clinical trials (if any) for the user’s specific disease. In addition, there are informational videos about some diseases—such as Lewy Body Dementia—and related blogs. Not all diseases have this feature as yet, but the plan is to have a video for each of the 6,000 diseases. This will take a few years, but will add tremendous value to the site.</p><p><strong>Pluses of the Site:</strong></p><ol><li>It contains an extremely large, mindboggling database, which is constantly updated. I looked up a few physicians with whom I’m familiar and found all the information was up-to-date.</li><li>The site is easy to navigate.</li><li>It does not rely on patient reviews. Instead, the physician ratings are based on each individual physician’s clinical experience, research, educational contributions, leadership role among peers, and recognition as an expert. These ratings are determined through a complex proprietary algorithm.</li><li>It has excellent customer support. I tried it out and received an answer to my emailed technical question about using the site (sent from the “Contact Us” page) within an hour on a Saturday morning!</li><li>It includes detailed educational material about each disease.</li><li>There is no charge for using the site, which is funded by private investors.   In conclusion, <a
href="https://www.xpertdox.com">XpertDox</a> is an excellent resource for those who need a personalized referral to the best physician specialized in Alzheimer’s or another disease.</li></ol><p><em>Marie Marley is the author of <a

Every time her daughter, Heidi, visited Helen showed no sign of recognizing her daughter. Heidi was heartbroken. Time after time it was the same. She’d visit and get no response whatsoever, so finally she made the painful decision to stop visiting. It only upset her and she believed her mother felt no pleasure during her visits.</p><p><strong>They May Recognize You but Not Be Able to Express it</strong></p><p>It’s always possible, however, that your loved ones do recognize you but are just not be able to show it.</p><p>I had a personal experience which I believe demonstrates this. I volunteer to visit three ladies with dementia at a local memory care facility. One of the ladies I was assigned to visit was named Doris</p><p>Doris was so frail that just about the most I could do with her was sit and hold her hand. I also talked to her a little but she rarely said anything in response. In fact she rarely said anything to anyone. She showed no sign of recognizing me from my previous visits.</p><p>Then one day – during my sixth visit &#8211; as I was holding her hand she put her other hand on my arm and began caressing it. I had the distinct feeling that she remembered me. I don’t think she would have been so openly affectionate to a total stranger.</p><p>I wasn’t really surprised when I found out that Doris passed away just a few days after that visit. I was so happy I’d gone all those times and that she’d been so responsive during my final visit.</p><p><strong>They May Remember How Often You Visit Even if They no Longer Remember Their Relationship with You</strong></p><p>I was speaking at an Alzheimer’s family support group recently. A man there told me that he visited his wife, who had advanced-stage dementia, nearly every day even though she didn’t recognize him as her husband. He learned early on, however, that she knew when he’d missed a day. She’d always say, “You didn’t come yesterday.”  Once he realized that she did remember if he’d been there, he tried even harder to never miss a day.</p><p><strong>They May Enjoy Being Visited, Even if They Don’t Know Who You Are</strong></p><p>I had another personal experience which led me to this conclusion. Although I was fortunate enough that my loved one with dementia always recognized me, he had many visitors he didn’t remember. I was present during some of these visits and it was always perfectly obvious that he enjoyed spending time with them.</p><p>When these people were there he’d often hold hands with one of them the whole time. And he’d have a long, pleasant talk with them. It was perfectly obvious he was enjoying himself.</p><p><strong>You May Feel Gratified That You’ve Given Them Pleasure</strong></p><p>Although the main focus of your visits are your loved ones, you might find there’s an unexpected benefit for you, too. You may initially feel hurt or frustrated that they don’t remember you, but if you can get over that hurdle and if it was clear that they enjoyed the visit, you will probably feel gratified that you gave them that pleasure. You may remain in a good mood afterward, too.</p><p>Can anyone think of other reasons you should visit loved ones who don’t recognize you?</p><p><em>Marie Marley is the award-winning author of ‘</em><a

We need twelve hugs a day for growth.” If we need that many hugs just think how many a person with Alzheimer’s must need.</p><p>Agnesi writes, “Hugs make us feel important, wanted, and loved. Who can resist the hugs of a child or grandchild, burying themselves in your arms? He continues by stating, “A hug is more powerful than a thousand words!”</p><p>An NIH <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12889546">article</a> reports on the largest published study on therapeutic touch. The study’s abstract states, “Outcomes from this continuous quality improvement (CQI) clinical study suggest that therapeutic touch . . . promotes comfort, calmness, and well-being. In addition, patients are highly satisfied with therapeutic touch.”</p><p>Marcus Felicetti published an <a
href="http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-5756/10-Reasons-Why-We-Need-at-Least-8-Hugs-a-Day.html">article</a> on the MindBodyGreen website that reviews the scientific research on the benefits of touch. He cites findings of the various research studies on which he reports. I’ll present five of the most important ones here:</p><ol><li>Hugs can instantly boost oxytocin levels, which heal feelings of loneliness, isolation, and anger.</li></ol><ol
start="2"><li>Holding a hug for an extended time lifts one’s serotonin levels, elevating mood and creating happiness.</li></ol><ol
start="3"><li>Hugs strengthen the immune system. The gentle pressure on the sternum and the emotional charge this creates activates the solar plexus chakra. This stimulates the thymus gland, which regulates and balances the body’s production of white blood cells, which keep you healthy and disease free.</li></ol><ol
start="4"><li>Hugging relaxes muscles. Hugs release tension in the body. Hugs can take away pain; they soothe aches in increasing circulation into the soft tissues.</li></ol><ol
start="5"><li>Hugs balance out the nervous system. The galvanic skin response of someone receiving and giving a hug shows a change in skin conductance. The effect in moisture and electricity in the skin suggests a more balanced state in the nervous system.</li></ol><p>The post <a

According to an article on the Live Strong website, “A study conducted by the British Dental Health Foundation showed the act of smiling to dramatically improve one’s mood.”</p><p>Another study, conducted by Dr. David Beales, co-author of “Emotional Healing for Dummies,” found that “Smiling causes a release of endorphins, your body’s natural pain-relieving and feel-good hormones.”</p><p><strong>Effects on the Person Being Smiled at</strong></p><p>Research has also discovered that being smiled at has positive effects. The British Dental Health Foundation, again as reported on the Live Strong website, states that “Smiling increases happiness both in yourself and those around you.”</p><p>A comprehensive article on this topic was published in Positive Psychology News Daily. Entitled “Smile and Others Smile With You: Health Benefits, Emotional Contagion and Mimicry,” the article reviews 10 scientific research studies on the benefits of smile for the person being smiled at. The article reports the following findings of the various studies:</p><ol><li>When you smile at someone, their muscles maneuver into a smile as well.</li></ol><ol
start="2"><li>This process is also known as emotional contagion. That is, emotions are contagious. Feeling good is infectious.</li></ol><ol
start="3"><li>Mimicking a person’s bodily state or facial expression causes physical responses in the receiver’s body that are identical to those in the sender’s.</li></ol><ol
start="4"><li>If you mimic [another person’s] smile . . . your body will release serotonin, dopamine and other “feel-good” indicators.</li></ol><ol

Lost in the memory of my just-completed visit to Ruth (not her real name).</p><p>She was quite confused that day. She told me that she had tried to rent an apartment that she liked very much, but before she could conclude the deal they fixed it up for someone else. I knew that wasn’t true but I empathized with her. “Oh, I’m <em>so</em> sorry,” I said.</p><p>Then I changed the subject to something pleasant. “I see you have some Sees candy here. Do you want a piece?”</p><p>“Oh, yes,” she said. “Will you have a piece with me?”</p><p>“Of course,” I answered. “Gimme that box!”</p><p>When I finally told her it was time for me to leave, she got a pouty look on her face and asked, “Oh, do you have to go?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m afraid I have to leave now. I wish I didn’t, but I’ll come back and see you next week.”</p><p>Then she walked with me to the door. She put her arms around me and hugged me very tightly.</p><p>“Oh, I <em>sure</em> am glad you stopped by. I <em>depend </em>on you. You’re my <em>friend,” </em>she said.</p><p>“I <em>love</em> coming to see you,” I said.</p><p>“See you next week,” I told her as I went out the door.</p><p>“See you,” she said, smiling and very gently closing her door.</p><p>This is why I volunteer. I felt warm all the way home. And I’m looking forward to next week when I can “find” the candy and enjoy some.

They may not even remember they have a daughter.</p><p>The same goes for questions such as “What did you do this morning?” Again, they probably won’t have the faintest idea what they did and they may just feel embarrassed or stupid.</p><p>It’s best to let the person save face and ask, “Are you enjoying your day?” or “How are you feeling today?”</p><p>Instead of asking, “Where did you go on the drive they took you on today?” you might ask, “Did you enjoy the drive?” (This assumes they just got back from the drive and will remember they went on one.)</p><p>Why and how questions tend to be too complicated for a person with Alzheimer’s. For example, they may have difficulty answering, “Why are you in such a bad mood today?” Again, you might say, “It seems you aren’t feeling well today.”</p><p>How questions also tend to have complicated answers. An example would be “How did you find your purse?” (which she had lost). She probably won’t remember she lost her purse let alone that she later found it.</p><p>We may also forget and ask,” Where did you find your purse?” And again she may feel bad that she can’t remember.</p><p>It’s better to say, “I see you found your purse. You must be happy about that.”</p><p>This is simple advice but it’s often hard to remember. So there we go again asking questions they most likely won’t be able to answer. “Where did they have the church service this morning?” or “Why did you skip the church service?”</p><p>We have to keep reminding ourselves not to expect them to remember recent details and not to be able to answer questions whose answers are complex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a

/> </strong></li></ol><ol
start="2"><li><strong>Make Eye Contact: </strong>This tip is related to the one above. If you’re standing behind the person you can’t make eye contact.<strong><br
/> </strong></li></ol><ol
start="3"><li><strong>Be at Their Level: </strong>If both you and they are standing that’s fine. But if they’re sitting on a chair it’s best if you kneel in front. This is especially important if they are in a wheelchair. Otherwise they will have to look up at you and they may feel you’re towering over them.<strong><br
/> </strong></li></ol><ol
start="4"><li><strong>Use Therapeutic Touch: </strong>People with Alzheimer’s may yearn to be touched, but you should ask for permission first and tell the person what you are going to do. Otherwise they may become alarmed.</li></ol><ol
start="5"><li><strong>Don’t Make Sudden Movements: </strong>This, too, may scare the person.</li></ol><ol
start="6"><li><strong>Offer to Shake Hands Every Time You Visit: </strong>They probably won’t remember you did it the last time. Put your hand out; they may reach for yours. If not let it go. This tip is related to therapeutic touch.<strong><br
/> </strong></li></ol><ol
start="7"><li><strong>Use Laughter. </strong> Alzheimer’s is a deadly serious disease. Nonetheless, sometimes laughter is the best medicine. Be sure to have some light-hearted stories to tell the person at each visit. I have found they may counter by telling you a funny story. Just be sure you’re laughing <em>with </em>the person, not <em>at them.</em><strong><br
/> </strong></li></ol><ol
start="8"><li><strong>Use Visual Cues: </strong>Point, touch or hand them the item you want them to use. For example, if you want them to drink some water, point to it or put a full glass near them and/or then pick it up and hand it to them.<strong><br
/> </strong></li></ol><ol
start="9"><li><strong>Palms up: </strong> Never sit with your arms crossed. This tends to convey anger just as it does when interacting with a person who does not have dementia. If you have your palms up it will probably be interpreted by the person as “I’m receptive to you” or “Take my hand” or “I like you.”<strong><br
/> </strong></li></ol><ol
start="10"><li><strong>Smile a Lot: </strong>This is probably the most important guideline of all. You will want to do this at any time (except if the conversation is more serious), but particularly when you’re telling the person something pleasant or humorous and when the person is telling you something of a like nature.</li></ol><p>The post <a

I had no idea how to survive the following years, but little by little I discovered things that helped tremendously. I want to share with you the events and situations that saved me, hoping they may help you as well.</p><p><strong>I Got Help From the Alzheimer’s Association: </strong>The Alzheimer’s Association helped me immeasurably. They had an online coaching service and I emailed my coach on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>I Kept a Journal: </strong>Keeping the journal became a creative outlet in its own right. It later formed the basis for my uplifting, award-winning book, <em>Come Back Early Today: A Memoir of Love, Alzheimer’s and Joy.</em> Alzheimer’s. Caregivers who have read it say it was very helpful to them. Previous caregivers say they wish they’d had it when they<em> were</em> caregivers.</p><p><strong>I Learned How to Get Along With Ed Better: </strong>A friend had life-saving advice for me: Don’t bring up topics that might upset Ed, If he does get upset, change the subject quickly, and Don’t argue, correct or contradict him. When I finally mastered these tips, our arguments decreased considerably and our relationship returned more or less to its former loving state.</p><p><strong>I Took up a Hobby About Which I Became Passionate: </strong>One day I wandered aimlessly around Best Buy until I came to the camera section. I ended up buying one. The best thing about my new hobby was that time stood still when I was doing “a shoot.” It took my mind completely off Ed and his condition.</p><p><strong>I Made Peace With Alzheimer’s: </strong>It’s one thing to admit a loved one has Alzheimer’s. It’s another entirely to accept the diagnosis in your heart. One day I started taking Ed stuffed animals. He loved them. We started playing games with them and giggled like a mother playing with her little toddler. One day I realized a profound change had taken place in my heart. I became aware that I <em>had </em>accepted his condition and I <em>had </em>found a way to relate to him. A way that was satisfying for both of us.</p><p>The post <a

This includes knocking before you enter the room and stepping out into the hall when personal care is being provided.</li><li> Be warm in interacting with your loved one. Smile frequently and use therapeutic touch unless the person specifically does not want to be touched.</li><li> Keep the conversation positive and refrain from arguing.</li></ul><p><strong>Don’ts for Visiting Your Loved One:</strong></p><ul><li>Don’t take unruly pets or children to visit. If the children are well behaved, however, they can provide extra pleasure to the patient. Take a pet if the person enjoys it, but check with the facility first to find out if they have a policy about pet visits.</li><li>Don’t wake up residents who are sleeping.</li><li>Don’t take food or beverages your loved one isn’t allowed to have. Check with the staff first if you have any questions about what’s permissible.</li><li>Don’t have large groups of family and/or friends visit at the same time. This may overwhelm residents or make them anxious. How many visitors are too many? This will be different for every resident. Observe your loved one’s mood and try to determine if there are too many people visiting.</li><li>Don’t stay too long. It may tire your loved one and interfere with the staff’s provision of needed care. How long is too long? That depends. Again, it is different for every resident. Look for cues that your loved one may be getting tired or stressed out.</li><li>Do not interrupt the resident’s activity time. Find out from the staff when activities are scheduled. It may be acceptable to sit beside them and just observe unless your presence distracts them from the activity.</li></ul><p>The post <a
